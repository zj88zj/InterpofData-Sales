<p>
<ol>
  <li>Data transformation and Dimension reduction: separate variables into Response, Demographics and Operation numbers groups and select a reduced list of factor variables.</li>
  <li>Explore and perform factor and cluster analysis for selected market segments.</li>
  <li>Adjust regression analysis for each segments to estimate potential gains in sales and list the hospitals in segments whose sales can be improved.</li>
